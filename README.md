# JSON API Document model
**Work in progress**

The goal of this library is to provide a transparent way to build JSON API Documents.
- A JSON API Document is an immutable value object which can be converted to JSON using `JSON.encode()`
- All JSON API Documents are guaranteed to comply with [JSON API v1.0](http://jsonapi.org/format/)
